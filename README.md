# RNN_deeplearning
This repository contains an implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict electric power consumption using real-world dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, RNN model training, and evaluation.
Features:

Dataset Handling: Reads and processes electric power consumption data.
Data Preprocessing: Converts timestamps, handles missing values, and normalizes data.
RNN Model: Implements a deep RNN with multiple layers for time series forecasting.
Training & Evaluation: Uses train-test split and loss metrics to evaluate model performance.
Visualization: Plots actual vs predicted power consumption for analysis.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Usage:

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Run the notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.
Adjust seq_length or model parameters to improve performance.
