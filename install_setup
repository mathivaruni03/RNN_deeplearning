Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Install dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
2️⃣ Check GPU Availability in TensorFlow:

python:
import tensorflow as tf
print("Num GPUs Available:", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
3️⃣ Run the script to train the RNN model on GPU.

Model Architecture:
SimpleRNN layers for sequential data processing.
Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
Adam optimizer for efficient training.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function for regression.

Usage:
Modify the dataset path in path = "your/dataset/path"
Adjust seq_length, epochs, and batch_size to fine-tune the model.
Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook to train & visualize results.
